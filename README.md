# PEAK functions for modu
making this so we can get to 200 modu packages so github linguist maintainers will stop roasting modu ðŸ”¥
## how 2 install
ok so you run `modu install peak_functions`<br>
and then you can include `peak_functions` in your projects :D<br>
like this!
```rust
import "peak_functions" as peak;
peak.FredFinder("example", true);
```
## faq
q: it doesnt work!!!?!! D:<br>
a: it works on my machine figure it out lol<br>
a but serious: try updating your modu version, we use quite modern technology in these packages like return statements and working if statements that dont break unlike past versions of modu (modu moment)
