# PEAK functions for modu
making this so we can get to 200 modu packages so github linguist maintainers will stop roasting modu ðŸ”¥
## how 2 install
ok so
you run `modu install peak_functions`
and then you can include `peak_functions` in your projects :D
like this!
```rust
import "peak_functions" as peak;
peak.FredFinder("example", true);
```
